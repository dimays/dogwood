# Dogwood

**_Dogwood is currently in development._**

Dogwood is a Game Engine for creating text-based games in Python. Dogwood games are played in the console, and can be played on Linux, OSX, Cygwin or other unix-like operating systems. The games can be easily packaged as an executable, so players don't need to have Python installed, or any experience with the console, in order to play.

The UI and back-end capabilities of Dogwood can be customized and extended, but it was designed to be simple to use. This way, developers can focus on the elements that make their games and stories unique.

When you create a new Dogwood game, it comes pre-configured with several features, such as a title screen, file select screen, save files to store progress on long adventures, a turn-based battle system, and much more!

To get started, check out the example games for inspiration and style guidance, and read the manual to get familiar with all the other options for your own game!
